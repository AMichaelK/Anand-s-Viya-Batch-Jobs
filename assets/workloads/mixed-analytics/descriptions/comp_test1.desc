 *
 * PASS NAME:  comp_test1a.sas
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   This computational test is a numercially intensive test 
 *
 *   We are doing stepwise linear regression and a stepwise logistic
 *   regression.  Performance can be increased if you can set the
 *   the MEMSIZE parameter high enough to cache the data for the
 *   the logistic regression.
 *
 *   This test is the same code as COMP_TEST2 and COMP_TEST3, but
 *   it only uses 25% of the total data.
 *
 * SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
 *   This test requires you to import data stored in the transport file 
 *   boardrm.tra into a SAS data set using the CIMPORT procedure.
 *
 *   Modify the Data Setup Section below to specify the path containing the
 *   boardrm data set.
 *
 * OUTPUT:  none
 *
 * SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  This test works with default settings.
 *
 * TEST CHARACTERIZATION:  CPU Intensive  
 *
 * SAS PRODUCTS INVOLVED:  base SAs, SAS/STAT
 * SAS PROCEDURES INVOLVED:  LOGISTIC, REG
