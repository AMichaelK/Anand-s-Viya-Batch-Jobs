 * This program is part of the Mixed Analytic Workload repository of
 *   test programs used to evaluate SAS concurrent workload.   
 * NAME:  comp_test2.sas
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   This computational test is a numercially intensive test going
 *   against a 182,973 row table with 297 variables.
 *
 *   We are doing stepwise linear regression and a stepwise logistic
 *   regression.  Performance can be increased if you can set the
 *   the MEMSIZE parameter high enough to cache the data for the
 *   the logistic regression.  A MEMSIZE of 512M should insure the
 *   the logistic regression runs in memory.
 *
 *   This test is the same code as COMP_TEST1 and COMP_TEST3, but
 *   it only uses 25% of the total data.
 *
 * SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
 *   This test requires you to import data stored in the transport file 
 *   boardrm.tra into a SAS data set using the CIMPORT procedure.
 *
 *   Modify the Data Setup Section below to specify the path containing the
 *   boardrm data set.
 *
 * OUTPUT:  none
 *
 * SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:  This test does run with the default parameters.
 *   However, you may want to set MEMSIZE to 256M to get better performance.
 *
 * TEST CHARACTERIZATION:  CPU Intensive  
 *
 * SAS PRODUCTS INVOLVED:  base SAS, SAS/STAT
 * SAS PROCEDURES INVOLVED:  LOGISTIC, REG
 *
 * DATA SOURCE:  boardrm.tra SAS transport file
 * DATA CHARACTERIZATION:  182,973 rows and 297 variables
